A '''person''' is a being, such as a [[human]], that has certain capacities or attributes constituting [[personhood]], which in turn is defined differently by different authors in different disciplines, and by different cultures in different times and places. In ancient Rome, the word &quot;[[persona]]&quot; (Latin) or &quot;[[prosopon]]&quot; (πρόσωπον: Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by actors on stage. The various masks represented the various &quot;personae&quot; in the stage play.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathEnc&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Geddes|first=Leonard|title=Person|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|year=1911|volume=11|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm|accessdate=2011-03-09|quote=The Latin word persona was originally used to denote the mask worn by an actor. From this it was applied to the role he assumed, and, finally, to any character on the stage of life, to any individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The current concept of person was developed during the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] and [[Christology|Christological]] debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to the word nature.&lt;ref&gt;Thisleton NIGNTC commentary on 1 Corinthians &quot;Thinkers in ancient times had a difficulty in expressing the notion of personality&quot;; Barfield in History of English Words “Take, for instance, the word person...Its present meaning of an individual human being is largely due to the theologians who hit upon it when they were looking for some term that would enable them to assert the trinity of Godhead without admitting more than one 'substance'&quot;; John Zizioulas in Being as Communion 1985 New York:St Vladimirs Press p27writes: &quot;although the person and “personal identity” are Widely discussed nowadays as a supreme ideal, nobody seems to recognize that historically as well as existentially the concept of the person is indissolubly bound up with theology&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; 
During the theological debates, some'philosophical tools (concepts) were needed so that the debates could be held on common basis to all theological schools. The purpose of the debate was to establish the relation, similarities and differences between the Λóγος/&quot;Verbum&quot; and God. The philosophical concept of person arose, taking the word &quot;[[prosopon]]&quot; (πρόσωπον) from the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. Therefore, Christus (the Λóγος/&quot;Verbum&quot;) and God were defined as different &quot;persons&quot;. This concept was applied later to the Holy Ghost, the angels and to all human beings.  

Since then, a number of important changes to the word's meaning and use have taken place, and attempts have been made to redefine the word with varying degrees of adoption and influence. In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about [[personal identity]]: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as he or she was or will be at another time despite any intervening changes. The common plural of &quot;person&quot;, &quot;[[people]]&quot;, is often used to refer to an entire [[nation]] or [[ethnic group]] (as in &quot;a people&quot;). The plural &quot;persons&quot; is often used in [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[law|legal]] writing.

==Personhood==
[[File:Paul Klee WI (In Memoriam) 1938.jpg|thumb|An abstract painting of a person by [[Paul Klee]]. The concept of a person can be very challenging to define.]]
{{main|Personhood}}

{{quotation|The criteria for being a person... are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.|Harry G. Frankfurt|}}
Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in [[philosophy]] and [[law]], and is closely tied to legal and [[political]] concepts of [[citizenship]], [[equality before the law|equality]], and [[liberty]]. According to law, only a [[natural person]] or [[legal personality]] has [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability]].
Personhood continues to be a topic of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of [[slavery]] and the fight for [[women's rights]], in debates about [[abortion]], [[fetal rights]] and [[reproductive rights]], and in [[animal rights]] advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of non-human personhood, see Midgley, Mary. [http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/midgley01.htm &quot;Persons and non-persons&quot;], in Peter Singer (ed.) ''In Defense of Animals''. Basil Blackwell, 1985, pp. 52-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various debates have focused on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of animals, women, and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, living adult humans are usually considered persons, but depending on the context, theory or definition, the category of &quot;person&quot; may be taken to include such [[Non human|non-human]] entities as [[animals]], [[artificial intelligences]], or [[extraterrestrial life]], as well as legal entities such as [[corporations]], [[sovereign states]] and other [[polities]], or [[estate]]s in [[probate]].&lt;ref&gt;For corporations, see [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html &quot;Justices, 5-4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit&quot;], ''The New York Times'', January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The category may exclude some human entities in [[prenatal]] development, and those with extreme mental impairment.

==Personal identity==
[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|What does it take for individuals to persist from moment to moment – or in other words, for the same individual to exist at different moments?]]
{{main|Personal identity}}

Personal identity is the [[Identity (philosophy)|unique identity]] of persons through time. That is to say, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the ''same'' person, persisting through time. In the modern [[philosophy of mind]], this concept of personal identity is sometimes referred to as the ''[[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]]'' problem of personal identity. The ''[[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]]'' problem is grounded in the question of what features or traits characterize a given person at one time.

Identity is an issue for both [[continental philosophy]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and [[analytic philosophy]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}. A key question in continental philosophy is in what sense we can maintain the modern conception of identity, while realizing many of our prior assumptions about the world are incorrect{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}.

Proposed solutions to the problem of personal identity include: continuity of the physical body, continuity of an immaterial mind or soul, continuity of consciousness or memory{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}, the [[bundle theory]] of self{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}, continuity of personality after the death of the physical body,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of post-mortal personhood, see Roth, S. (2013) ''Dying is only human. The case death makes for the immortality of the person''. Tamara Journal for Critical Organization Inquiry, Vol. 11, No. 2, pp. 35-39. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2260793]&lt;/ref&gt; and proposals that there are actually no persons or selves which persist over time at all{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}.

==Early life==
Rosser was born in [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union]], [[New Jersey]]. He began watching [[professional wrestling]] during the mid-1980s and became interested in becoming a professional wrestler as a teenager, wrestling in several [[backyard wrestling]] federations. He attended [[Union High School (New Jersey)|Union High School]] in New Jersey, where he played [[American football]], both offensively and defensively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Varsallone-pg1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/04/26/1599309/young-believes-hes-nxt.html|title=Young believes he's NXT|date=April 26, 2010|last=Varsallone|first=Jim|accessdate=July 23, 2010|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|page=1|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rRTktb1V|archivedate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] where he played football for a year, before deciding to focus on his academic studies and professional wrestling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Varsallone-pg1&quot;/&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Training and independent circuit===
Rosser became interested in becoming a [[professional wrestler]] as a teenager, wrestling in several [[backyard wrestling]] federations. He researched a number of wrestling schools before deciding on Camp IWF in [[West Paterson, New Jersey|West Paterson]], [[New Jersey]]. This was due in part to his employer, whose uncle was a friend of a local wrestler training there at the time, and helped him enroll in the wrestling school.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECWAInterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecwaprowrestling.com/main/superspotlight/ss-frederickhollywood-12-2006.html|title=Superstar Spotlight on Frederick of Hollywood|author=Martin, Josh|year=2006|month=December|publisher=ECWAProWrestling.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosser made his professional debut in 2002 and spent several years on the independent circuit, including wrestling for the Independent Wrestling Federation and [[Chaotic Wrestling]] during his early career. On May 17, 2003, he won his first major title when he defeated the IWF Heavyweight Championship in Woodland Park, New Jersey and held it for over half a year until losing to Roman on January 17, 2004. It was at a house show in Chaotic Wrestling that he was first noticed by promoter Jim Kettner and invited to compete for the [[East Coast Wrestling Association]] where he made his debut in the summer of 2004. Shortly after entering the promotion, Rosser began feuding with [[Prince Nana]] over the [[ECWA Mid Atlantic Championship]] and eventually defeated him for the title&lt;ref name=&quot;ECWAInterview&quot;/&gt; in [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], [[Delaware]] on September 18, 2004. He lost the title to Nick Malakai less than two months later.

===World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE===
During 2005 and 2006, Rosser made several appearances for [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) on its weekly programs ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'' and ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]'' as well as in [[dark match]]es on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' and ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Combat-Hooligans&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://combat-hooligans.com/2007/12/05/iwf-wrestling-school-begins-9th-year-this-weekend/|title=IWF Wrestling School Begins 9th Year this Weekend|date=December 5, 2007|publisher=Combat-Hooligans.com}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WrestleView&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2006/1198785373.shtml|title=New episode of Pro Wrestling Ohio TV, 'CHIKARA' update + IWF events|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=December 27, 2007|publisher=WrestleView.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developmental territories (2009–2010)====
In May 2009, Rosser signed a WWE developmental contract and was sent to WWE's [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territory]], [[Florida Championship Wrestling]], under the name '''Darren Young'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OWOW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/d/darren-young.html|title=Darren Young|accessdate=April 27, 2010|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Varsallone-pg2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/04/26/1599309_p2/young-believes-hes-nxt.html|title=Young believes he's NXT|date=April 26, 2010|last=Varsallone|first=Jim|accessdate=July 23, 2010|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|page=2|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rRU3hMWN|archivedate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In FCW, Young was in a tag team called The South Beach Party Boys with [[Percy Watson]]. On February 16, 2010, it was announced that he would compete as part of the first season of ''[[WWE NXT]]'', mentored by [[CM Punk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_39115.shtml|title=WWE News: Complete cast of the NXT show revealed including The Miz mentoring Bryan Danielson|date=February 16, 2010|last=Caldwell|first=James|accessdate= February 17, 2010|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NXT and The Nexus (2010)====

On February 23, 2010, Young made his debut on ''WWE NXT'' with a character described as a &quot;South Beach Party Boy&quot;, losing his debut match to [[David Otunga]]. His storyline had mentor CM Punk showing apathy towards him, claiming he had no idea why he's in ''NXT'' and did not want to train Young unless he accepted his Straight-edge lifestyle.&lt;ref name=NXT022310&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/130807/411%5C%5Cs-WWE-NXT-Report-2.23.10.htm|title=411's WWE NXT Report 2.23.10|last=Bauer|first=Michael|date=February 23, 2010|accessdate=March 4, 2010|publisher=411Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Punk and his disciples, [[Drew Hankinson|Luke Gallows]] and [[Serena Deeb|Serena]], helped Young win his rematch against Otunga the following week.&lt;ref name=Torch03022010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_39503.shtml|title=Keller's WWE NXT Report 3/2: Competition explained, Cornfed Meathead debuts, Punk, Hardy, Regal, Jericho, Miz appear with Rookies|date=March 2, 2010|last=Keller|first=Wade|accessdate=March 4, 2010|work=PWTorch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young was ranked eight in the first Pros' Poll. After the pros' poll, Young decided to join the Straight Edge Society in an attempt to improve, only to change his mind before getting his hair shaved off. CM Punk decided to forgive him for standing up to him when he defeated Luke Gallows with Young's own hair on the line. Because of this victory, CM Punk had then been interested in Young's potential, but in turn started feuding with a jealous Luke Gallows.
